    <p>I like this movie more about the Hero's story of A man, who doesn't believe that love can last a lifetime, pursues an exuberant romantic, but their clashing ideologies keep them apart.
        Like me he also does not believe in everlasting love. However, he makes it clear that love between two people is never the same as it first is.
        He has gone through nine loves in his life and thinks that love between two people eventually dies out. 
        As a person with strong morals, he is honest and wants to love life and live with an open mind, open thought, and open action with his lover. But in the end, he sacrifices his passion and decides to propose his girlfriend again, trying to be committed this time.
        <b>From this learned like sacrifices are a very integral part of any relationship.</b>
